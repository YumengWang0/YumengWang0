## Hi there 👋

<!--
**YumengWang0/YumengWang0** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

- 🌱 I’m an incoming fifth-year Ph.D. student in Applied and Computational Mathematics at Missouri University of Science and Technology.  
- 🔍 I’m actively seeking opportunities in **Data Science**, **Machine Learning Engineering**, **Research Engineering**, or **Quantitative Analysis**.  
- 🧠 My research interests include **scientific computing**, **deep learning for practical problems**, and **transformer-based foundation models** for spatial-temporal data (especially involving **partial differential equations (PDEs)**) .  
- 🌐 Feel free to explore my [personal website](https://YumengWang0.com) to learn more.
